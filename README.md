# Transformer in variational bases for electronic quantum states

This repository contains all the scripts used to generate and analyze the data in the paper "Transformer in variational bases for electronic quantum states". 
Note: It needs some refactoring.


Authors: João Augusto Sobral (University of Stuttgart), Michael Perle (University of Innsbruck) and Mathias S. Scheurer (University of Stuttgart).

This repository contains code adapted from the [Yuanhangzhang98/transformer_quantum_state](https://github.com/yuanhangzhang98/transformer_quantum_state).

João is thankful for insightful discussions with Yuan-Hang Zhang (also for making his code for the transformer_quantum_state open_source), Sayan Banerjee, Lucas Pupim, Vitor Dantas and Michael Muehlbauer.
